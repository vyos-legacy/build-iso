VyOS ISO Build Procedures

    This document describes how to build a VyOS ISO image. The most
    recent version of this document is the top-level README file from 
    the default branch of the "build-iso" git source repository.


Build Host Setup

    The current VyOS ISO build requires a Debian "squeeze"-based system.
    As of now, "squeeze" is the Debian "stable" release. Therefore, to
    install a minimal squeeze system, download a squeeze installer "netinst"
    or "businesscard" ISO image from the following Debian page:

      http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/debian-installer/

    The supported architectures currently include "i386" and "amd64".
    During the installation, choose "Standard system utilities" when
    selecting the software to be installed (note that this is the minimal
    requirements and one can certainly install more packages).

    After the installation and reboot, your "apt" sources.list file should
    be configured to use the Debian mirror that you selected during the
    installation. In order to build the VyOS packages and the ISO,
    install the following packages using "apt-get" or "aptitude".

      git                      # Required, for cloning the source
      autoconf                 # Required, for generating build scripts
      dpkg-dev                 # Required, used in build scripts
      live-helper              # Required, for ISO build
      syslinux                 # Required, for ISO build
      genisoimage              # Required, for ISO build
      make                     # Required, for ISO build
      lsb-release              # Required, used by configure script
      ssh                      # Optional, for cloning over SSH
      sudo                     # Optional, ISO build requires root privileges
      fakechroot               # Required, for ISO build
      devscripts               # Optional, for building submodules (kernel etc)

     If you want to build individual packages rather than an ISO from precompiled
     packages, you may need some of the following:

      kernel-package           # Optional, for building the kernel
      libtool                  # Optional, for building certain packages (eg vyatta-op-vpn)
      libglib2.0-dev           # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg 
      libboost-filesystem-dev  # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg
      libapt-pkg-dev           # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg
      flex                     # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg
      bison                    # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg
      libperl-dev              # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg
      libnfnetlink-dev         # Optional, for building vyatta-cfg-vpn

    The list of submodule build dependencies is not limited to these though,
    follow the procedures from the Build Host Setup for Building Submodules
    section.

    Now install the VyOS package repository GPG key.

      wget -O - http://packages.vyos.net/vyos-pubkey.gpg  | sudo apt-key add -

Tools update:
    You will also need to download and install a newer "squashfs-tools"
    package from the squeeze-backports repository. VyOS uses extended
    file attributes, and older (pre 4.2) versions do not handle attributes.

    Debian instructions on how to setup squeeze-backports.
    Add backports to your sources.list
    1. Add this line
       deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
    to your sources.list (or add a new file with the ".list" extension to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)
    2. Run apt-get update

    After that do:
      sudo apt-get -t squeeze-backports install squashfs-tools

Getting "build-iso" Source

    The VyOS ISO builder consists of scripts and config files
    maintained as a git repository named "build-iso". First, clone
    the build-iso git repository.

	git clone https://github.com/vyos/build-iso.git

    This will create the source tree in the directory "build-iso".
    (At this point, you might want to switch to reading
    ./build-iso/README, which is the most recent version
    of the file which you are reading now:-)

    Our git repositories have branches, which usually correspond to
    different releases. To switch to a particular branch (let's call
    it BRANCH), do the following.

	cd build-iso
	git checkout --track -b BRANCH origin/BRANCH


Build ISO

    To build a VyOS ISO, do the following in the "build-iso" directory
    (which has been set up as described in the previous section).

    Select the kernel type to include in the finished iso image by
    setting flavor to one of the available types (this also applies if
    you are building your own kernel package as well):

    586-vyos (defaults to this if not set)
    586-vyos-virt
    amd64-vyos 

        flavor=586-vyos
        export PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH
        autoreconf -i
        ./configure --with-kernel-flavor=$flavor

    Execute make

        sudo make iso

    The end results is the following livecd ISO image.

        livecd/binary.iso

    Note that the above build process uses the pre-built binary packages
    from the VyOS package repository, which contains the
    latest development packages built by the maintainers.

    If you want to make modifications to one or more packages, you will
    need to get the source of the submodule(s) that you want to change,
    make the changes, build the submodules, and then build a new ISO to
    include the new packages. This is discussed in the next section.


Build Host Setup for Building Submodules

    VyOS code is organized in multiple submodules instead of a huge
    single repo. For more information about submodules see
    http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules

    Before you start building submodules, install the following packages:
        devscripts # Provides debuild

    To fetch submodule source, use:
        cd build-iso
        git submodule update --init pkgs/$submoduleName

    e.g.
        git submodule update --init pkgs/vyatta-cfg-system

    After that you need to switch to the target branch:
        cd pkgs/$submoduleName
        git branch $branch --track origin/$branch
        git checkout $branch

    You can lookup the current development branch at http://vyos.net

    Submodules may have build dependencies not present in the system by default.
    You can install build dependencies by running the following
    command inside a submodule:
        ../../tools/install-submodule-build-deps

    If you just want to see what the dependencies are, run "dpkg-checkbuilddeps"
    inside the submodule. This is the command the install-submodule-build-deps
    script is using.

    Some submodules require packages not available from Debian Squeeze
    repositories. Known cases at this point include:

    * vyatta-quagga
        Requires libsnmp newer than available in Debian Squeeze. To build it,
        you need to build pkgs/net-snmp submodule and install generated
        packages first.
    * libnetfilter-conntrack
        Requires libmnl, which is not in Debian Squeeze. Build pkgs/libmnl and
        install generated packages first.
    * conntrack-tools
        Requires libnetfilter-conntrack, libnetfilter-cttimeout, libnetfilter-cthelper,
        libnetfilter-queue. Build and install these first.

    The alternative to building those dependencies from source is to install them from
    the VyOS repository, http://packages.vyos.net/vyos/ (set distribution to the current
    development branch).

   [There may be more cases of unusual dependencies. Also, there may be packages with
    redundant or missing build dependencies, as clean up of the code inherited from
    Vyatta is still work in progress, so if you spot anything like that, please
    let maintainers know]


Build submodules

    When you do a "make", the build system will build the binary packages
    for all cloned submodules and include them in the ISO (pre-built
    packages from the Vyatta "unstable" package repository will be used
    for the submodules that are not cloned). If you want to work with
    specific submodules, you can use the commands listed below.

    Using make targets

      There are a number of top-level make targets for working with
      submodules. The commands below use submodule "vyatta-cfg" as an
      example.

      To build ".deb" packages for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "debuild -i -b -uc -us -nc"):

        make vyatta-cfg

      To clean the build for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "debuild clean"):

        make clean-vyatta-cfg

      To do a "release" for the vyatta-cfg submodule (equivalent to
      "pkg-release -p", i.e., auto-generate everything and no confirmation):

        make release-vyatta-cfg

    Using submod-mk script

      The submod-mk script in tools/ can also be used to work with submodules.
      To build binary packages for cloned submodule(s),

        tools/submod-mk { --all | SUBMODULE... }

      To build binary and source packages for submodule(s),

        tools/submod-mk --source { --all | SUBMODULE... }

      To build signed binary and source packages for submodule(s),

        tools/submod-mk --signed-source { --all | SUBMODULE... }

      To clean files generated during submodule build,

        tools/submod-clean SUBMODULE...

      To clean files generated during all submodule builds,

        tools/submod-clean

      To also clean the submodule build stage(s),

        tools/submod-clean -d [ SUBMODULE... ]

      To clean the source tree of submodules to skip subsequent builds,

        tools/submod-clean -g [ SUBMODULE... ]

      This retains the local bare git repository for quicker updates.

Changes

    If you want to share your changes, there are two options:

    1. Email patches
        Use "git format-patch -${number of commits}" command. It will produce
        one or more patch files in your repo directory. Email these patches to
        maintainers@vyos.net or (better) add them to the corresponding bug on
        http://bugzilla.vyos.net as attachments.

    2. Fork the submodule on github and make pull request.

Updates using git

    Update the super-module.

	git pull
	git submodule init

    To update all modules, you can use:

	tools/submod-git pull

    Or for the paranoid

	tools/submod-git fetch
	git whatchanged HEAD..origin/master
	git merge

    To see which checked-out submodules have upstream modifications,

	git status		# search for changes in pkgs/

    Get the "from" and "to" commit ids (SHAs) with,

	git diff pkgs/SUBMODULE

    This will produce output something like,

	diff --git a/pkgs/vyatta-cfg-quagga b/pkgs/vyatta-cfg-quagga
	index 78124a9..fca1739 160000
	--- a/pkgs/vyatta-cfg-quagga
	+++ b/pkgs/vyatta-cfg-quagga
	@@ -1 +1 @@
	-Subproject commit 78124a9754efe0bda1d9c827c593c5e0635fec3c
	+Subproject commit fca1739f1985c2ba8d6316b1882365f5e26245cd

    To review what changed between these SHAs,

	cd pkgs/SUBMODULE
	git whatchanged FROM_SHA TO_SHA

    To merge these submodule changes,

	git merge
	cd ../..
	git submodule update

    The "git status" for this submodule should now be clean. Iterate
    through the other updated submodules, then rebuild the ISO.
